# Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) Lab Experiments  

This repository contains a collection of lab experiments performed during our 3rd-year **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** coursework. The experiments focus on implementing and analyzing various algorithmic techniques to solve computational problems efficiently. The topics covered include:  

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementations of Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, etc.  
- **Divide and Conquer**: Solving problems using recursion and subproblem decomposition.  
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Optimization techniques applied to problems like Huffman Encoding and Kruskal’s Algorithm.  
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solutions for problems like the Knapsack problem, Floyd-Warshall Algorithm, and Longest Common Subsequence.  
- **Graph Algorithms**: Implementations of BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s Algorithm, and Minimum Spanning Trees.  
- **Backtracking**: Solving constraint satisfaction problems like N-Queens and Subset Sum.  

## Repository Structure  
- Each experiment is placed in a separate directory.  
- Includes **source code**, **problem statements**, and **analysis** of time and space complexity.
